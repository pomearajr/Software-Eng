Most of the charts are easy to understand, but not all of the code provide in the examples are not needed.
It mostly depends on how the information is structured in the .csv file will dictate how the code looks.
In general which chart you used to depict date depends on the data given to the programmer.
For me in general, I prefer line and bar graphs over heat and bubble graphs.
The most complex graph for reading for me is the bubble map, which is only useful for interactive maps, this is because
it groups data rather than it being in a x vs y format.
